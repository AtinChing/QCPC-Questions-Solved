# Problem B. Adjacent Differences
# Possible categories I would associate with this:
# Matrix, Math
# I've figured out an algorithm, and attached a picture of some of the rough sketches on my whiteboard. It's late night so I'll code it later.
# Point of the algorithm is to work off of the 1 3 matrix for all other matrices.
#                                              2 4
# The attachment of the picture is on README.md
